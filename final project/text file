Project Summary: AdventureWorks Sales Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview:
In this project, I have built a professional Business Intelligence dashboard from scratch. I followed a structured 6-step process to transform raw sales data into interactive insights.

Detailed Steps Performed:

1. Data Modeling:

Created a clean 'Star Schema' by connecting Fact and Dimension tables using Primary and Foreign keys.

Organized the data view by hiding unnecessary fields and ensuring consistent naming.

2. DAX Measures & Calculated Columns:

Wrote advanced DAX formulas using functions like CALCULATE, FILTER, and SUMX.

Created calculated columns for Profit Margin classification and formatted Customer names.

3. Time Intelligence:

Developed measures to track Year-Over-Year (YOY) and Month-Over-Month (MOM) growth for sales and returns.

Identified seasonal trends using time-based data.

4. Dashboard Layout:

Designed a 4-page layout: 1 Main Dashboard, 2 Detail pages, and 1 Drillthrough page.

Used variety of visuals like KPI Cards, Line Charts, Bar Charts  and Donut Charts to show trends and forecasts.

Added "Top N" lists for both Products and Customers to highlight best performers.

5. Filtering & Interaction:

Added Slicers .

Enabled Drill-Up and Drill-Down features to explore data at different levels.

6. Navigation & UX:

Added "Page Navigator" buttons (In DrillThrough page) for smooth movement between report pages.

Enabled Tooltips and Conditional Formatting  to make the data easy to read.

"The dashboard accurately captures negative profit periods, showing where costs exceeded revenue."

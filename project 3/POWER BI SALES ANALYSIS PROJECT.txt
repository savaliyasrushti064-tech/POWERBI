POWER BI SALES ANALYSIS PROJECT

Step 1: Data Loading
Loaded fact and dimension tables into Power BI.
Fact table contains sales transaction data.
Dimension tables include Date, Product, Region, and Customer.
Verified data types and removed errors.

Step 2: Data Modeling
Created relationships between fact and dimension tables.
Used Many-to-One relationships from fact to dimension tables.
Ensured single-direction cross filtering.
Verified model in Model view.

Step 3: Dedicated Measure Table
Created a separate table to store all DAX measures.
Used Enter Data to create a dummy table.
Hid the dummy column.
Moved all measures to this dedicated measure table.

Step 4: Basic Measures
Created basic measures using DAX:
- Total Sales
- Total Cost
- Total Profit
Used these measures in Matrix visuals only.

Step 5: Quick Measures
Used Quick Measure option for time-based calculations.
Configured required fields correctly.
Displayed results using Matrix visual.

Step 6: Filter Context and Behavior
Used CALCULATE to modify filter context.
Compared sales with filters and without filters.
Used ALL() to remove Region filter.
Used FILTER() to apply conditional logic.
Displayed comparison using Matrix visual.

Step 7: Matrix with ALL, FILTER, CALCULATE
Created measures for:
- Sales with filter
- Sales without filter using ALL()
- Conditional sales using FILTER()
Added Region in Rows and measures in Values in Matrix.
Observed difference between filtered and unfiltered results.

Step 8: DAX Operators and Functions
Used arithmetic operators to calculate:
- Profit
- Profit Margin
Used logical functions like IF to classify profit or loss.
Displayed all results in Matrix visual.

Step 9: Iterator Functions
Used SUMX for row-by-row calculation.
Used AVERAGEX to calculate average sales per product.
Displayed iterator results in Matrix visual.

Step 10: Time Intelligence
Marked Date table properly.
Used TOTALYTD to calculate Year-to-Date sales.
Used SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR to calculate last year sales.
Calculated Year-over-Year growth.
Displayed all time intelligence measures in Matrix visual.

Conclusion
This project  modeling, DAX measures, filter context, iterator functions, and time intelligence in Power BI.
All analysis outputs are shown using Matrix visuals as per project requirement.
